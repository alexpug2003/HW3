        <p>I'm passionate about staying active and practicing various sports and activities. Whether it's playing soccer, perfecting my golf swing, or dominating the pickleball court, I love the challenge and excitement of each game.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Soccer:</strong> I enjoy both watching and playing, especially following the Premier League and Italian Serie A.</li>
            <li><strong>Golf:</strong> Hitting the course my buddies or family is the perfect mental getaway.</li>
            <li><strong>Pickleball:</strong> Allows me to get exposure to racket sports like tennis without the high degree of skill required.</li>
            <li><strong>Pool (Billiards):</strong> A game of precision and strategy that I enjoy casually in Curry Gameroom or out with friends.</li>
