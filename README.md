In doing this homework assignment, I incorporated several CSS customizations to improve the aesthetics and functionality of my website.
First, I customized the typography by selecting a modern, clean font that enhances readability. I also adjusted font sizes for headings and paragraphs to create a well-structured hierarchy, making it easier for visitors to navigate and understand the content.
Next, I implemented a consistent color scheme throughout the website. I selected complementary background and text colors to ensure readability and visual appeal. Additionally, I applied hover effects on navigation links, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.
To enhance the websiteâ€™s layout, I used margins and padding adjustments to create appropriate spacing between elements. This ensures that text and images are well-organized and visually balanced. I also applied flexbox/grid layouts for structuring content, making the design more dynamic and responsive across different screen sizes.
A key customization was the navigation bar styling. I designed a navigation menu that allows users to move seamlessly between pages. The links are styled distinctly and change color when hovered over, providing clear visual feedback to the user.
Lastly, I focused on image styling to improve the visual appeal of my site. I added borders and shadows to images, ensuring they blend well with the overall design. Additionally, I adjusted image sizing and placement to maintain a clean and structured layout.
